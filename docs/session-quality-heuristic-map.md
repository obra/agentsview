# Coach Heuristic Map for agentsview Session Quality

Phase: 1 planning artifact only.

This document maps AI Engineering Coach heuristics to agentsview-compatible
signal families and records which candidates are safe to use for deterministic
per-session scoring. It intentionally does not change runtime scoring, database
schema, APIs, or UI behavior.

Sources inventoried:

- `/tmp/AI-Engineering-Coach/src/core/rules/*.md` (45 built-in rules)
- `/tmp/AI-Engineering-Coach/src/core/detectors/scoring.ts`
- `/tmp/AI-Engineering-Coach/src/core/analyzer-insights.ts`
- Current agentsview signal code in `internal/signals` and
  `internal/sync/signal_compute.go`

## Current agentsview signal inputs

agentsview currently has deterministic access to:

- Session metadata: agent, project, machine, started/ended timestamps, message
  counts, output/context token summaries, automation flag, parent/relationship,
  cwd/git branch, termination status, and existing health signal columns.
- Message data: role, content, content length, timestamp, model, token usage,
  context/output tokens, system flag, source metadata, sidechain and compact
  boundary flags.
- Tool data: tool name, category, input JSON, skill name, result content,
  subagent session id, result event status, result timestamps, and event order.
- Usage data: model, input/output/cache/reasoning tokens, cost, source, and
  occurrence timestamp.

agentsview does not currently have reliable first-class request records,
explicit request cancellation, agent/plan mode, slash command, custom
instruction usage, tool confirmation/approval mode, request elapsed time, AI
generated LOC, human review timing, or parsed file-reference inventories.

## Signal Families

- `prompt_quality`: user prompt shape, constraints, success criteria,
  verification language, duplication, and task-start structure.
- `context_quality`: file/code context, context pressure, compactions, prompt
  cache behavior, and context-engineering habits.
- `workflow_hygiene`: session outcome, abandonment, drift, task length, timing,
  and loop behavior.
- `tool_mastery`: tool use, retries, failed tools, edit churn, MCP/skill usage,
  subagents, and command habits.
- `cost_model_hygiene`: model choice, cache economics, output verbosity, and
  premium/reasoning use.
- `aggregate_analytics`: cross-session, cross-project, or long-horizon habits
  that should not affect a single session score.

## Proposed Phase 2 Score Candidates

These are the only Coach-derived candidates that are initially safe enough for
per-session score consideration. Weights are guidance for later phases, not
implemented behavior.

| Proposed signal | Family | Coach source | Inputs available now | Initial weight guidance | Confidence | Scoring notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `short_prompt_count` | `prompt_quality` | `lazy-prompting` | User message content length | 2 points each, cap 6 | Medium | Count non-empty user prompts under about 30 chars. Keep small because terse expert prompts can be valid. |
| `constraintless_prompt_count` | `prompt_quality` | `low-constraint-usage` | User message content | 2 points each, cap 6 | Medium | Detect explicit constraint language. Do not penalize read-only Q&A sessions unless task intent suggests implementation/debugging. |
| `missing_success_criteria_count` | `prompt_quality` | Coach prompt maturity analyzer | User message content | 2 points each, cap 6 | Medium-low | Use as a weak prompt-quality signal only for implementation/debugging task starts. |
| `missing_verification_count` | `prompt_quality` | Coach prompt maturity analyzer | User message content | 2 points each, cap 6 | Medium-low | Penalize only when the user is asking for code or behavior changes. |
| `unstructured_start` | `prompt_quality` | `no-spec-structure`, `no-spec-driven-development` | First user message, message count, tool/edit evidence | 6 points once | Medium | Session-level flag for multi-turn agentic/code sessions whose first prompt lacks headings, bullets, numbered steps, spec keywords, constraints, or plan language. |
| `duplicate_prompt_count` | `prompt_quality` | `repeated-prompts` | Normalized user message content | 3 points each, cap 9 | High | Exact or near-exact repeated prompts inside one session are a strong signal of unclear progress. |
| `no_code_context_count` | `context_quality` | `no-file-context` | User message content plus tool/edit evidence | 3 points each, cap 6 | Medium-low | Only score when code-task intent is detectable. General questions and planning conversations must be excluded. |
| `runaway_tool_loop_count` | `workflow_hygiene` | `runaway-agent-loops` | Tool calls grouped between user turns or across session windows | 8 points each, cap 16 | High | Strongest new candidate. Gate on high tool volume and repeated/failing tool patterns so normal large edits are not penalized. |

Recommended Phase 2 total cap for all new prompt/content-derived penalties:
20 points. This keeps the existing outcome/tool/context score dominant while
new prompt-quality signals are calibrated.

## Already Covered by Existing Score

| Coach heuristic | Existing agentsview signal | Family | Score surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `abandon-sessions` | `outcome_abandoned` | `workflow_hygiene` | Already covered score | agentsview classifies ended-with-user sessions as abandoned with confidence gates. Coach's aggregate abandoned-session rate can remain analytics-only. |
| `high-cancellation` | `tool_failure_signals` for cancelled tool result events | `workflow_hygiene` | Partially covered score | Request cancellation is unavailable. Do not add a cancellation penalty until explicit request cancellation exists. |
| `mega-sessions` | `compactions`, `mid_task_compactions`, `context_pressure_high` | `context_quality` | Already covered score | Long sessions alone are not necessarily poor. Current context-pressure signals capture the risky part. |
| Coach scoring detector: canceled request penalty | Existing tool result cancellation only | `workflow_hygiene` | Partially covered score | Explicit cancelled requests are missing. |
| Coach scoring detector: short prompt penalty | `short_prompt_count` candidate | `prompt_quality` | New score candidate | Use a smaller cap than Coach's weekly score because agentsview scores individual sessions. |
| Coach scoring detector: no file refs penalty | `no_code_context_count` candidate | `context_quality` | New score candidate | Must be intent-gated. |
| Coach scoring detector: late-night/weekend penalties | Time heatmaps and aggregate analytics | `aggregate_analytics` | Analytics only | Do not score a session because it occurred at a particular hour or weekday. |
| Coach scoring detector: speed accept penalty | Blocked until review timing and AI LOC exist | `tool_mastery` | Excluded | See blocked table. |
| Coach scoring detector: no tools/no slash command penalty | Tool mix analytics and skills data | `tool_mastery` | Insights/analytics only | Not a per-session quality failure by itself. |

## Coach Rule Mapping

`Adoption` values:

- `score`: suitable for deterministic per-session scoring after Phase 2
  implementation.
- `aggregate`: useful for aggregate analytics only.
- `insights`: useful for generated or surfaced insights, not score.
- `covered`: already represented by existing agentsview scoring or analytics.
- `blocked`: exclude until required data exists or false-positive risk is
  reduced.

| Coach rule | Coach group | agentsview family | Proposed agentsview mapping | Adoption | Confidence | Required inputs and notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `abandon-sessions` | session-hygiene | `workflow_hygiene` | `outcome_abandoned`; aggregate abandoned-session rate | covered | High | Existing outcome classification covers per-session abandonment. Aggregate rate can be reported without new score logic. |
| `agent-mode-for-asks` | prompt-quality | `cost_model_hygiene` | `simple_question_agent_mode_rate` | blocked | Low | Needs explicit agent mode, request-level code output, request cancellation, and reliable simple-question classification. Misleading as score. |
| `agentic-no-tools` | tool-mastery | `tool_mastery` | `agentic_no_tool_request_rate` | insights | Low | Needs explicit agent mode. A no-tool agent turn can be valid for planning or explanation. |
| `auto-approve-terminal` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `auto_approved_terminal_count` | blocked | Low | Needs approval/confirmation mode metadata not currently stored. Security signal, not score until data is exact. |
| `auto-avoidance` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `manual_model_selection_rate`, `auto_model_absence` | blocked | Low | Needs explicit auto-model availability/selection metadata. Current model mix alone cannot prove avoidance. |
| `broken-flow-state` | session-hygiene | `aggregate_analytics` | `low_score_rapid_followup_rate` | aggregate | Medium | Cross-day habit based on follow-up timing and low scores. Do not penalize individual sessions. |
| `cache-hit-starvation` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `prompt_cache_starvation_rate` | aggregate | Medium | Usage events include cache-read and input-token fields. Keep as cost analytics, not quality score. |
| `caps-lock` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `caps_prompt_count` | insights | Medium | Potential frustration signal, but subjective and culturally noisy. No per-session penalty. |
| `context-engineering-gaps` | prompt-quality | `context_quality` | `context_engineering_gap_summary` | insights | Medium-low | Mixed feature inventory across file refs, instructions, skills, MCP, and subagents. Several inputs are incomplete today. |
| `copy-paste-blindness` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `ai_loc_without_refinement_count` | blocked | Low | Needs AI-generated LOC and review/refinement evidence. Not available. |
| `excessive-file-context` | prompt-quality | `context_quality` | `excessive_file_context_rate` | aggregate | Low | Requires structured referenced-file counts. Tool read/search calls are only a weak proxy and should not score. |
| `frustration-signals` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `frustration_prompt_count` | insights | Medium | Useful for insight copy but not a quality penalty. |
| `high-cancellation` | session-hygiene | `workflow_hygiene` | `request_cancellation_rate` | blocked | Low | Explicit request cancellation is unavailable. Tool cancellation remains covered by failure signals. |
| `instruction-bloat` | prompt-quality | `context_quality` | `instruction_context_bytes` | aggregate | Low | Needs reliable custom/system instruction extraction by source. Avoid per-session score. |
| `late-night-coding` | session-hygiene | `aggregate_analytics` | `late_night_session_rate` | aggregate | High | Timestamps are available. This is a work-pattern insight, not a session-quality penalty. |
| `lazy-prompting` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `short_prompt_count` | score | Medium | Available from user message length. Keep capped and intent-aware. |
| `low-constraint-usage` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `constraintless_prompt_count` | score | Medium | Available from prompt text. Use conservative regexes and low cap. |
| `low-markdown-ratio` | prompt-quality | `aggregate_analytics` | `documentation_output_ratio` | blocked | Low | Needs reliable output file extension/LOC extraction. Code block language alone is insufficient. |
| `mcp-tool-bloat` | tool-mastery | `tool_mastery` | `distinct_tool_count`, `distinct_mcp_tool_count` | aggregate | Medium | Tool names are available. High tool count can reflect complex work, so aggregate only. |
| `mega-sessions` | session-hygiene | `context_quality` | `long_session_count`; existing context signals | covered | High | Session length is available, but score should stay tied to compaction/context pressure. |
| `model-overreliance` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `top_model_share`, `model_diversity` | aggregate | High | Model mix exists. This is portfolio analytics, not per-session score. |
| `no-custom-instructions` | tool-mastery | `context_quality` | `custom_instruction_absence_rate` | blocked | Low | No explicit custom-instruction usage field. System messages are not a reliable substitute. |
| `no-devcontainer` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `unsandboxed_terminal_rate` | blocked | Low | Needs runtime/container/sandbox metadata. Do not infer from Bash usage. |
| `no-file-context` | prompt-quality | `context_quality` | `no_code_context_count` | score | Medium-low | Score only for detectable code tasks. Exclude general Q&A, ideation, and pure planning. |
| `no-language-exploration` | code-review | `aggregate_analytics` | `new_language_weekly_count` | blocked | Low | Needs parsed language inventory from user/assistant code or changed files. Not a session score. |
| `no-plan-mode` | tool-mastery | `tool_mastery` | `planning_mode_usage_rate` | blocked | Low | Needs explicit plan-mode metadata. Prompt keywords are too weak for scoring. |
| `no-skills` | tool-mastery | `tool_mastery` | `skill_usage_rate`, `distinct_skill_count` | aggregate | Medium | `tool_calls.skill_name` is available for some agents. Absence is not a per-session failure. |
| `no-slash-commands` | tool-mastery | `tool_mastery` | `slash_command_usage_rate` | blocked | Low | Slash command metadata is not currently parsed. Not a score candidate. |
| `no-spec-driven-development` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `spec_driven_session_rate`; contributes to `unstructured_start` | aggregate | Medium | Aggregate habit is useful. Per-session scoring should use only the narrower task-start structure signal. |
| `no-spec-structure` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `unstructured_start` | score | Medium | Safe when gated to multi-turn code/agentic sessions. |
| `premium-for-lookup-questions` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `premium_lookup_question_rate` | insights | Medium-low | Model and cost data exist, but "lookup question" classification is brittle. Use cost insight, not score. |
| `premium-waste` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `premium_short_prompt_rate` | insights | Medium-low | Cost insight only. Short prompts can be legitimate with rich prior context. |
| `profanity` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `hostile_language_count` | insights | Medium | Personal tone should not reduce deterministic session score. |
| `reasoning-effort-overuse` | tool-mastery | `cost_model_hygiene` | `high_reasoning_effort_rate` | blocked | Low | Usage events expose reasoning tokens, not requested effort setting. Keep out until effort metadata exists. |
| `repeated-prompts` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `duplicate_prompt_count` | score | High | Normalize text and count duplicates within a session. Strong signal when repeated after assistant/tool work. |
| `runaway-agent-loops` | session-hygiene | `workflow_hygiene` | `runaway_tool_loop_count` | score | High | Tool calls are available. Combine high tool volume with retries/failures or repeated categories. |
| `session-drift` | session-hygiene | `workflow_hygiene` | `session_intent_drift_count` | insights | Low | Requires reliable work-type classification. Useful for insight summaries, not score. |
| `slow-responses` | session-hygiene | `workflow_hygiene` | `slow_response_count` | blocked | Low | Request elapsed time is unavailable. Session duration is not equivalent. |
| `speed-accept` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `speed_accept_count` | blocked | Low | Needs AI LOC plus human review/accept timing. Not available. |
| `tunnel-vision` | code-review | `aggregate_analytics` | `top_project_share` | aggregate | High | Project distribution is available. This is portfolio analytics only. |
| `verbose-output` | prompt-quality | `cost_model_hygiene` | `verbose_output_rate` | insights | Medium | Output tokens are available. Avoid score because verbosity can be requested or useful. |
| `verbose-prompt-no-compression` | prompt-quality | `prompt_quality` | `verbose_uncompressed_prompt_rate` | insights | Low | Compression-skill detection is incomplete and verbose prompts can be deliberate. |
| `vibe-coding` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `large_ai_loc_low_prompt_count` | blocked | Low | Needs AI LOC and review evidence. Not available. |
| `weekend-overwork` | session-hygiene | `aggregate_analytics` | `weekend_session_rate` | aggregate | High | Timestamps are available. Work-life analytics only. |
| `yolo-mode` | code-review | `tool_mastery` | `auto_approval_rate` | blocked | Low | Needs explicit approval/confirmation metadata. Do not infer from Bash or Edit calls. |

## Coach Insights Analyzer Mapping

| Coach analyzer area | agentsview mapping | Adoption | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intent classification | `session_intent`, `intent_distribution` | insights | Can be keyword-assisted, but should not affect deterministic score until validated. |
| Spec-driven development | `spec_driven_session_rate`, `unstructured_start` | aggregate plus score sub-signal | Aggregate rate is useful. Only the narrow `unstructured_start` flag belongs in scoring. |
| Production vs review ratio | `ai_loc_review_ratio` | blocked | Needs AI LOC and review gap data. |
| Sustainable pace | late-night/weekend/streak analytics | aggregate | Good analytics and insight material, explicitly excluded from score. |
| Prompt maturity | constraints, success criteria, verification, context provision, specificity dimensions | insights plus selected score sub-signals | Use dimensions for insights. Only simple deterministic absence counts are score candidates, capped conservatively. |
| Migration readiness | feature usage matrix for subagents, MCP, instructions, plan mode, skills, slash commands, multi-file edits, terminal access, file references, parallel sessions | insights | Several fields are partial or agent-specific. Good for adoption insights, not quality score. |

## Blocked Data Fields

The following fields would be needed before adopting currently blocked rules:

- Request boundary model: first-class user request records with associated
  assistant response, tool calls, elapsed time, cancellation, and generated code
  artifacts.
- Mode metadata: agent mode, plan mode, auto-model setting, slash command, and
  requested reasoning effort.
- Safety metadata: tool confirmation prompts, auto-approval state, yolo mode,
  sandbox/devcontainer state, and terminal approval source.
- Context metadata: parsed file references, custom instruction provenance,
  instruction byte counts, and explicit MCP/tool catalog size.
- Code/review metadata: AI-generated LOC, edited LOC, accepted change timing,
  human follow-up review gaps, changed file extensions, and code language
  inventory.

Until these fields exist, the affected Coach rules should remain excluded from
per-session scoring.

## Implementation Guidance for Later Phases

1. Add prompt/content scorers as pure functions under `internal/signals`, taking
   already-loaded messages and tool calls as inputs.
2. Keep score computation deterministic and local. Do not call LLMs for scoring.
3. Gate prompt-quality penalties to code-task or multi-turn task sessions where
   possible.
4. Preserve existing health score semantics by capping all new Coach-derived
   prompt/context penalties at 20 total points.
5. Store aggregate-only heuristics separately from score-affecting session
   signals so analytics and health scores do not drift together.
6. When parser changes introduce new required fields, follow the repository data
   safety rule: full resync through a fresh database, orphan session copy, and
   atomic swap; do not delete or recreate the persistent archive in place.
